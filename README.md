üì£ **I'm looking for someone to work with me on developing Paperlib.** üì£

 If you are interested please contact me. 

## Introduction

I'm a computer science PhD student. Conference papers are in major in my research community, which is different from other disciplines. Without DOI, ISBN, metadata of a lot of conference papers are hard to lookup (e.g., NIPS, ICLR etc.). When I cite a publication in a draft paper, I need to manually search the publication information of it in Google Scholar or DBLP over and over again.

**Why not Zotero, Mendely?**

- A good metadata scraping capability is one of the core function of a paper management tool. Unfortunately, there is no software in this world that does this well, not even commercial software.

- A modern UI. No extra useless features.

What we need may be: import a paper, scrape the metadata of it as accurately as possible, simply organise the library, and export it to BibTex when we are writing our own papers.

That is Paperlib.


## Highlights
-   Scrape paper‚Äôs metadata with many scrapers. Support write your own metadata scrapers. Tailored for many disciplines (still growing):
    - [x] **General**
        - [x] arXiv
        - [x] doi.org
        - [x] Semantic Scholar
        - [x] Crossref
        - [x] Google Scholar
        - [ ] Springer (üöß in progress...)
        - [ ] Elseivier Scopus (üöß in progress...)
    - [x] **Computer Science and Electronic Engineering**
        - [x] openreview.net
        - [x] IEEE
        - [x] DBLP
        - [x] Paper with Code (scrape avaliable code repository)
    - [ ] **Earth Science** (üößin progress...)
    - [ ] **Physics** (üößin progress...)
        - [ ] NASA Astrophysics Data System (üößin progress...)
        - [ ] SPIE: Inte. Society for Optics and Photonics (üößin progress...)
    - ...
-   Fulltext and advanced search.
-   Rating, flag, tag, folder and markdown/plain text note.
-   RSS feed subscription to follow the newest publications in your research topic.
-   Locate and download PDF files from web.
-   MacOS spotlight-like plugin to copy paste reference easily when writing a draft paper.
-   Cloud sync, supports macOS and Windows.
-   Beautiful and clean UI.

## Download and Install

## Contribute to Paperlib

### Metadata Scrapers
My research topic is computer vision, which is only one piece of puzzle of the computer science. I tried to contact some friends to provide information about the paper matadata database in different disciplines. However, However, it does not cover all disciplines. If the [builtin metadata scrapers](https://github.com/GeoffreyChen777/paperlib/tree/master/app/repositories/scraper-repository/scrapers) are not suitable for your research, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

### New Features

I'm open to any new feature request, we can discuss it in the issue.
